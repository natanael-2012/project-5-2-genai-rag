        "## **📌 Introduction**\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (**RAG**) is an AI framework that enhances **information retrieval** by combining:\n",
        "- A **vector database** to retrieve relevant documents.\n",
        "- A **Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate contextualized responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is widely used in **legal research, finance, customer support, and knowledge management**, improving accuracy and relevance in automated systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **📌 Project Overview**\n",
        "This project aims to build a **RAG system** focused on **finance laws and regulations**. By integrating **document retrieval** and **LLM-based generation**, the system will provide **accurate, contextualized answers** to legal and financial queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will experiment with different **embedding models** (e.g., OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-large` vs. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and **vector databases** (e.g., ChromaDB) to optimize retrieval and response generation.\n",

        "## **🎯 Goals**\n",
        "✔ Develop a **RAG pipeline** specialized in finance law and legal text retrieval.  \n",
        "✔ Compare **OpenAI embeddings** and **Sentence Transformers** for legal text retrieval.  \n",
        "✔ Evaluate the system based on **retrieval accuracy** and **response relevance**.  \n",
        "✔ *(Bonus)* Deploy the system as a **web application** using Streamlit or Flask.  \n",
        "✔ *(Bonus)* Incorporate **legal case studies** and **financial reports** for richer context.  \n",

        "\n",

        "### **Text Splitter Selection**\n",

        "1. **`CharacterTextSplitter`** → Splits text into **fixed-length chunks** with controlled overlap.  \n",

        "✔ **Preserves context** using an **overlap of 200 characters**.  \n",
        "✔ **Prevents excessive fragmentation**, ensuring chunks retain **complete, meaningful information**.  \n",
        "✔ **Offers predictable behavior**, making retrieval tuning easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Implementation Steps**\n",
        "1. **Initialized an empty list (`all_docs[]`)** to store processed chunks.\n",
        "2. **Created a text splitter** (`CharacterTextSplitter`) with `chunk_size=1000` and `chunk_overlap=200`.\n",
        "3. **Looped through the PDF files**, loading each document and splitting them into **pages**.\n",
        "4. **Further split each page into smaller chunks**, maintaining meaningful context.\n",

In response to the mandate given by the G-20, in September 2009 the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), agreed on a number of measures to strengthen the regulation of the banking sector.

(122) The primary purpose of the legal framework for credit institutions should be to ensure the operation of vital services to the real economy while limiting the risk of moral hazard. The structural separation of retail and investment banking activities within a banking group could be one of the key tools to support this objective. No provision in the current regulatory framework should therefore prevent the introduction of measures to effect such a separation. The Commission should be required to analyse the issue of structural separation in the Union and submit a report, together with legislative proposals, if appropriate, to the European Parliament and the Council. (123) Similarly, with a view to protecting depositors and preserving financial stability, Member States should also be permitted to adopt structural measures that require credit institutions authorised in that Member State to reduce their exposures to different legal entities depending on their activities, irrespective of where those activities are located. However, because such measures could have a negative impact by fragmenting the internal market, they should only be approved subject to strict conditions pending the entry into force of a future legal act explicitly harmonising such measures.

              "(4) Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (1) allows investment firms authorised by the competent authorities of their home Member State and supervised by the same authorities to establish branches and provide services freely in other Member States. That Directive accordingly provides for the coordination of the rules governing the authorisation and pursuit of the business of investment firms. It does not, however, establish the amounts of the initial capital of such firms ora common framework for monitoring the risks incurred by them, which should be provided by this Directive. (5) This Directive should constitute the essential instrument for the achievement of the internal market from the point of view of both the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide financial services in the field of credit institutions. (6) The smooth operation of the internal market requires not only legal rules but also close and regular cooperation and significantly enhanced convergence of regulatory and supervisory practices between the competent authorities of the Member States. (7) Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) established the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (\" EBA\"). This Directive should take into account the role and function of EBA set out in that Regulation and the procedures to be followed when conferring tasks on EBA. (8) Given the increase of tasks conferred on EBA by this Directive and by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should ensure that adequate human and financial resources are made available. (9) Asa first step towards a banking union, a single super­ visory mechanism (SSM) should ensure that the Union's policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a coherent and effective manner, that the single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same manner to credit institutions in all Member States concerned, and that those credit insti ­ tutions are subject to supervision of the highest quality, unfettered by other, non-prudential considerations. An SSM is the basis for the next steps towards a banking union. This reflects the principle that any introduction of common intervention mechanisms in the event of a crisis should be preceded by common controls to reduce the likelihood that such intervention mechanisms will have to be used. The European Council noted in its conclusions of 14 December 2012 that \" the Commission will submit in the course of 2013 a proposal fora single resolution mechanism for Member States participating in the SSM, to be examined by co-legislators as a matter of priority with the intention of adopting it during the current parliamentary cycle. \". The integration of the financial framework could be further enhanced through the setting up of a single resolution mechanism, including appropriate and effective backstop arrangements to ensure that bank resolution decisions are taken swiftly, impartially and in the best interests of all concerned. (10) The conferral of supervisory tasks on the European Central Bank (ECB) for some of the Member States should be consistent with the framework of the European System of Financial Supervision setup in 2010 and its underlying objective to develop the single rulebook and enhance convergence of supervisory practices across the Union as a whole. The ECB should carryout its tasks subject to and in compliance with any relevant primary and secondary Union law, Commission decisions in the areas of State aid, competition rules and merger control and the single rulebook applying to all Member States. EBA is entrusted with developing draft technical standards and guidelines and recommendations"

              "(4) Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments (1) allows investment firms authorised by the competent authorities of their home Member State and supervised by the same authorities to establish branches and provide services freely in other Member States. That Directive accordingly provides for the coordination of the rules governing the authorisation and pursuit of the business of investment firms. It does not, however, establish the amounts of the initial capital of such firms ora common framework for monitoring the risks incurred by them, which should be provided by this Directive. (5) This Directive should constitute the essential instrument for the achievement of the internal market from the point of view of both the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide financial services in the field of credit institutions. (6) The smooth operation of the internal market requires not only legal rules but also close and regular cooperation and significantly enhanced convergence of regulatory and supervisory practices between the competent authorities of the Member States. (7) Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) established the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking Authority) (\" EBA\"). This Directive should take into account the role and function of EBA set out in that Regulation and the procedures to be followed when conferring tasks on EBA. (8) Given the increase of tasks conferred on EBA by this Directive and by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should ensure that adequate human and financial resources are made available. (9) Asa first step towards a banking union, a single super­ visory mechanism (SSM) should ensure that the Union's policy relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions is implemented in a coherent and effective manner, that the single rulebook for financial services is applied in the same manner to credit institutions in all Member States concerned, and that those credit insti ­ tutions are subject to supervision of the highest quality, unfettered by other, non-prudential considerations. An SSM is the basis for the next steps towards a banking union. This reflects the principle that any introduction of common intervention mechanisms in the event of a crisis should be preceded by common controls to reduce the likelihood that such intervention mechanisms will have to be used. The European Council noted in its conclusions of 14 December 2012 that \" the Commission will submit in the course of 2013 a proposal fora single resolution mechanism for Member States participating in the SSM, to be examined by co-legislators as a matter of priority with the intention of adopting it during the current parliamentary cycle. \". The integration of the financial framework could be further enhanced through the setting up of a single resolution mechanism, including appropriate and effective backstop arrangements to ensure that bank resolution decisions are taken swiftly, impartially and in the best interests of all concerned. (10) The conferral of supervisory tasks on the European Central Bank (ECB) for some of the Member States should be consistent with the framework of the European System of Financial Supervision setup in 2010 and its underlying objective to develop the single rulebook and enhance convergence of supervisory practices across the Union as a whole. The ECB should carryout its tasks subject to and in compliance with any relevant primary and secondary Union law, Commission decisions in the areas of State aid, competition rules and merger control and the single rulebook applying to all Member States. EBA is entrusted with developing draft technical standards and guidelines and recommendations"
