        "This project aims to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** focused on **finance laws and regulations**. By integrating a **vector database** for document retrieval and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** for response generation, the system will provide **accurate, contextualized answers** to legal and financial queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will experiment with different **embedding models** (e.g., OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` vs. `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and **vector databases** (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS) to optimize information retrieval and response generation.\n",
